Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings.

Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping).

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping).

That being said, if you are hyper sensitive to noise (cars driving by occasionally and birds singing in the backyard) you might want to find a place more sound proof. If you're hypersensitive to light (the sun coming up in the morning) you might want to find a place with black out curtains. Also, if you're hyper sensitive to wind (Airconditioning and ceiling fans) you won't be happy here as I like to keep it a comfortable 78 degrees Fahrenheit.99 of my guests have been amazing.

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities. I look forward to sharing with you the best that Palm Springs has to offer!"

Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities. I look forward to sharing with you the best that Palm Springs has to offer!"

Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities. I look forward to sharing with you the best that Palm Springs has to offer!"

Butterfly Alexander home in Palm Springs-Pool and Hot Tub Modernism comes alive in our 3BR/2BA Palm Springs house. Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings.

Butterfly Alexander home in Palm Springs-Pool and Hot Tub Modernism comes alive in our 3BR/2BA Palm Springs house. Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings.

The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings.

After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings.

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more.

A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping).

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities.

Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."

Feel free to place food items in the fridge, use the kitchen, use the pool, use the Wifi watch movies on Netflix. Lovely outdoor dining area in the back yard off your bedroom. It's a nice, quiet, safe neighborhood. That being said, if you are hyper sensitive to noise (cars driving by occasionally and birds singing in the backyard) you might want to find a place more sound proof. If you're hypersensitive to light (the sun coming up in the morning) you might want to find a place with black out curtains. Also, if you're hyper sensitive to wind (Airconditioning and ceiling fans) you won't be happy here as I like to keep it a comfortable 78 degrees Fahrenheit.99 of my guests have been amazing. I hope you enjoy your stay as much as I enjoy being your host!"

The bathroom is generally private but at times may be shared with guests in another bedroom. Surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, community includes 2 pools, 2 spas, 2 tennis courts and VIEWS. Im happy to present to you a private room in my large, ground-floor end unit at the popular Estados South community in South Palm Springs. On site are two pools, two spas and two tennis courts! Although I'm fairly new to airbnb, I've been renting out my condo to vacationers since 2006 on another travel Web site, and have many past reviews I can share with you (or send you a link to a separate Web site I maintain for the property). Just email me! I am moving out full time to the condominium in July 2015, but will still rent out the entire place during the winter season as well as this private bedroom other parts of the year. After visiting the Palm Springs area for many years, when I decided to buy a second home, this condominium immediately felt like home and was also large enough to entertain guests. Besides its large size and sizable outdoor patio, its ground floor location and westward-facing mountain views are what really set it apart from other condominiums in Palm Springs. Best of all, the shade from a large avocado tree keeps the unit shielded from the hot afternoon sun almost all day. Want to work in the living room or on the patio Bring your laptop with a wireless connection and you can work just about anywhere you want! Another reason I bought this condominium was the facilities offered at Estados South: two pools (now heated year-round with solar panels), two always-on spas, two tennis courts and beautiful landscaping courtesy of our on-site gardener. We also have a very dedicated HOA Board of Directors who ensure that our community is maintained and is financially sound, which is why weve got guests who have returned for many years to enjoy the surroundings. When its time to go out, youre within minutes of the shops, art galleries and great restaurants of downtown Palm Springs (with free parking) as well as numerous golf courses, hiking trails, the Palm Springs Tram up to the mountains and other amenities. I look forward to sharing with you the best that Palm Springs has to offer!"

Butterfly Alexander home in Palm Springs-Pool and Hot Tub Modernism comes alive in our 3BR/2BA Palm Springs house. Pop Art pieces and the homeowners original sculpture pop up all over this house, including the fabulous pool and hot tub area with a mural climbing the wall. Close to everything downtown has to offer, including the shopping on famous North Canyon Drive! INSIDE THE HOUSEIts easy to see why this distinctive house was on the Palm Springs Modernism Tour three years ago. If you love art, youll appreciate the curvy entry made from stainless steel squares that wrap around to the open kitchen and serve as part of the backsplash area, reflecting light from different angles. The open living space, from the striking coffee table to the leather couches, provides space for 6 to hang out and watch the flat screen TV or grab a book off the bookshelves. The kitchen is distinctive, with frosted cupboards and stainless appliances. Have cocktail hour at both a bespoke breakfast bar that seats 4 and a glass dining table for 4 more. Three bedrooms sleep 6 guests. The master has a king, while the two other bedrooms have queens. All feature work-of-art details like fabric headboards and original paintings and sculpture. The master en suite bath has a side door entry to the pool/patio, so you can sneak out for midnight dips. The second bathroom is just newly updated with a nice walk-in shower. But we saved the best for last: the whole backside of the open concept house is glass. A wall of windows and patio doors overlook the simply divine pool and patio area, and tall hedges make the space completely private. Not to be overlooked is the hot tub at the side of the house, great for unwinding after a hike in the dessert (or a long day of shopping). From early morning coffee on the patio to twilight around the pool, you will have an unforgettable experience at this one-of-a-kind artists home."
